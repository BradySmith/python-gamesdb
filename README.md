python-gamesdb
==============

python-gamesdb is a python client for gamesdb api (http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php?title=API_Introduction)

Presently, most but not all API calls are supported.  Retrieval for most images has not yet been developed, however it is
fairly complete for fetching data about games and platforms.

# Prerequisites
The prerequisites for this pacakge are generally provided as a part of base Python and should not require any special installation.

* [urllib](http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html): Installed by default with most modern Python interpreters.  Used to make HTTP requests and read responses.
* [urllib2](http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html): Installed by default with most modern Python interpreters.  Used to make HTTP requests and read responses
* [ElementTree](http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html): Installed by default with most modern Python interpreters.  Used to parse XML responses.

#Usage

## Basics

In order to use this library you must first instantiate a GamesDB object.

```python
from gamesdb.api import API
gamesdb_api = API()
```

## Specific Calls

### Get Platforms List

[GamesDB GetPlatformsList API Call](http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php?title=GetPlatformsList)

This call takes no arguments, and returns a list of Platform objects, with the id, name, and alias fields supplied:

```python
platform_list = gamesdb_api.get_platforms_list()
for platform in platform_list:
    print platform.id, "-", platform.name, "-", platform.alias
```

**Output:**

```
5 - 3DO - 3do
4911 - Amiga - amiga
4914 - Amstrad CPC - amstrad-cpc
4916 - Android - amstrad-cpc
23 - Arcade - arcade
22 - Atari 2600 - atari-2600
...
```


### Get Platform

[GamesDB GetPlatform API Call](http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php?title=GetPlatform)

This call retrieves all available details for a platform, based off of the id returned in get_platforms_list().

```python
atari_platform = gamesdb_api.get_platform('22')
print atari_platform.name
print atari_platform.overview
```

**Output:**

```
Atari 2600
The Atari 2600 is a video game console released in October 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and cartridges containing game code, instead of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware with all games built in. The first game console to use this format was the Fairchild Channel F; however, the Atari 2600 receives credit for making the plug-in concept popular among the game-playing public.
The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200, in 1982, the VCS was renamed &quot;Atari 2600&quot;, after the unit&#039;s Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a cartridge gameâ€”initially Combat and later Pac-Man.

The Atari 2600 was wildly successful, and during much of the 1980s, &quot;Atari&quot; was a synonym for this model in mainstream media and, by extension, for video games in general.

### Get Platform Games

[GamesDB GetPlatformGames API Call](http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php?title=GetPlatformGames)

Retrieve a list of games based on the platform id retrieved in get_platform_list, with id, title, and (if available) release date populated.  Note that at the moment, release date comes back inconsistently formatted based on what the API response supplies.

```python
atari_games_list = gamesdb_api.get_platform_games('22') # Atari 2600 Platform id
for game in atari_games_list:
    print game.id, "-", game.title, "-", game.release_date
```

**Output:**

```
206 - Commando - None
207 - Dig Dug - 01/01/1982
10128 - H.E.R.O. - 01/01/1984
1292 - Ghostbusters - 1984
1341 - Amidar - 01/01/1982

1348 - Gravitar - None
1349 - Indy 500 - 01/01/1977
1350 - Joust - None
...
```
### Get Game

[GamesDB GetGame API Call](http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php?title=GetGame)

Retrieve all of the available details for a game, based off of the game id, or name.  If passing in name, you may optionally filter results by Platform.  Note that when your query returns only one game (as it the case when querying by id) it will return one game.  When your query returns more than one item, it will return a list of Games.  When your query returns no reesults, None will be returned.

#### Get Game by id

```python
game = gamesdb_api.get_game(id="1350")
print game.title
print game.overview
print game.genres
print game.developer
```

**Output:**

```
Joust
Joust is a platforming game where the player controls a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich from a third-person perspective. The player navigates the protagonist around the game world, which consists of rock platforms floating above a flat island surrounded by lava.
Platform

```
#### Get Game by Name

```python
game = gamesdb_api.get_game(id="1350")
print game.title
print game.overview
print game.genres
print game.developer
```

**Output:**

```
